# surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis

- Identify and interpret the structures, interactions and the types of data in a provided dataset
- Differentiate between both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases
- Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database
- Use statistics to analyze data
- Design a Flask application using data

The analysis was conducted on the temperature trends before a surf shop was opened. The focus was temperature data for the months of June as well as December in Oahu. This was done to identify if the surf and ice cream ship business will be sustainable all year with the help of SQLite and SQLAlchemy.
