# surfs_up

## Overview of the statistical analysis

- Identify and interpret the structures, interactions and the types of data in a provided dataset
- Differentiate between both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases
- Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database
- Use statistics to analyze data
- Design a Flask application using data

The analysis was conducted on the temperature trends before a surf shop was opened. The focus was temperature data for the months of June as well as December in Oahu. This was done to identify if the surf and ice cream ship business will be sustainable all year with the help of SQLite and SQLAlchemy.

## Resources
- SQLite
- Python 3.7.6
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy
- Pandas

## Results
The two tables are displayed below for June and December:
![December_temperatures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95547517/155833563-d2c11cad-d5de-487c-930c-6d275853eb0b.png)
![June_temperatures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95547517/155833568-a33076a7-1c06-4eed-ae09-5f974151e00e.png)

- The average of the December table and the June is quite close to one another both being in the 70s.
- The June count is much higher than the December count which could cause inaccuracy in the statistical analysis.
- There is not a major difference betweem the max between the two months which demonstrates there isn't a drastic change between the two months.

## Summary
Overall, the results demonstate that both months are relatively similar and there is the chance of promising sales in both month with December being slightly colder. To improve the results, there are also other data results that could be used to address the results which include rainy days as well as wind conditions.
